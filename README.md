## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Airbnb [Seattle Open Data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) from Jan 2016 to Jan 2017 to answer following business questions:

1. What is the average daily booking price for a couple stay in Seattle Airbnb?
2. How much do Seattle Airbnb homes are earning in certain time frames of the year?
3. Which are the busiest/expensive neighbourhoods in Seattle?
4. What are the most common type of Airbnb properties in Seattle?
5. Is there anything about the properties that can help us to predict the price?

To clone the repository use: git clone https://github.com/JSanjayam/seattle_airbnb_exploratory_data_analysis.git

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There 3 csv files used for the analysis are downloaded from kaggle.

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://jayshreesanjayam.medium.com/exploratory-data-analysis-on-seattle-airbnb-homestays-dbeed8855b63).
